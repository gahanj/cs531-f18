## Assignment 0-0, CS 431/531, Fall 2018

Due: 2018-09-05

Points available: 5

### Part 1 -- Join the mailing list 

* Join [https://groups.google.com/group/cs531-f18](https://groups.google.com/group/cs531-f18) and send an email introducing yourself.  

### Part 2 -- Join GitHub

* Set up an account on GitHub using the [educational package](https://education.github.com/).  This allows free private repositories and lots of other goodies.

### Part 3 -- Create your private class repository

* Add [me](https://github.com/phonedude) as a "collaborator".
* The repository must be private -- public repositories will not be graded!

### Part 4 -- Tell me what your class repository is

1. Fork my class repository: [https://github.com/phonedude/cs531-f18](https://github.com/phonedude/cs531-f18)
1. Add a file in the "users" directory.  The name of the file is your ODU CS account name (i.e., your account name on the linux.cs.odu.edu machines), and the file will only contain the URI of your GitHub class repo (e.g., https://github.com/RandomODUAcctName/CS-418-Fall-2018)
1. Issue a "pull request" to my repo so I can gather all the (acct,repo) pairs
