Due: 2018-11-30

Points available: 6 max

"Soft 404s" are a well-known concept, but there are also "soft 401s" and "soft 403s".  We want to uncover actual 401s and 403s.

### 401s in the wild

* find and post up to three different "in the wild" examples of 401 response codes (they should come from three different sites)
* the examples have to be different from those in the class slides and those already shared on the list

### 403s in the wild

* find and post up to three different "in the wild" examples of 403 response codes (they should come from three different sites)
* the examples have to be different from those in the class slides and those already shared on the list
