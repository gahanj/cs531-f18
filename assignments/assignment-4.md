### Notes

* Implement Basic and Digest Authentication as per Week 10 slides (and RFCs 7617 and 7616). 
* In your server configuration file: provide private key (any word or phrase) to use in generating nonce & opaque values
(yes, this is not the safest way to do this).
* provide a configurable value for how to protect directories 
    * default name is = "WeMustProtectThisHouse!"
    * all functions combined in a single file for simplicity (you would normally separate them)
    * this file protects the directory it is in, and recursively protects all of its sub-directories
* sample file:

`#`
`# Hashed lines are comments`
`# order is not important, but here are `
`# two special lines:`
`#`
`authorization-type=Basic`
`realm="Lane Stadium"`
`# always quote realm since it might have spaces `
`#`
`# user format = name:md5(password)`
`#`
`mln:d3b07384d113edec49eaa6238ad5ff00`
