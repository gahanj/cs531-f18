### Additional response headers

### Notes

* PUT, DELETE are allowed recursively, as per directives in the WeMustProtectThisHouse! file
* Limits: 
    * URI: 2k
    * Entity: 2MB
* You should check for entities longer than advertised as per the "Content-Length" header, but I will not test this
* Always issue an HTML description describing the results (success or failure) of PUT and DELETE (we will not produce 202 or 204)
* Invoke the URI as an executable program iff: POST, GET, HEAD methods are used
    * POST, GET, HEAD methods are used
    * the file is executable (and not a directory)
* Warning!!! -- ensure your URI is relative to your document root (e.g., "GET /bin/rm?-rf HTTP/1.1" would be very bad)
* Update the log format to include the "user-agent:" and "Referer:" request headers:
`"%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\""`
* use "ALLOW-PUT" and "ALLOW-DELETE" in the WeMustProtectThisHouse! file, as per lecture 11:

````#
ALLOW-PUT
ALLOW-DELETE
